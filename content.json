    "description": "I study Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I chose this university because of its combination of strong academic programs, a beautiful campus, exciting sports culture, and diverse student organizations. The range of social events and clubs here—paired with accessible academic and career resources—has made it a great environment for growth. In Fall 2025, the new CDIS (Computer, Data, and Information Sciences) building will open, offering cutting-edge facilities and collaboration space designed specifically for computer science majors like myself."
